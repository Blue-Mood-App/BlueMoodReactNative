## About Blue Mood

Blue Mood is a full-stack mobile app that helps users manage their mood and mental health through a fun and personalized experience. The app allows the user to determine what activities that they want to pursue depending on their current mood. The problem the app attempts to solve is based on the idea that some people struggle with being able to improve their moods on their own and therefore Blue Mood is a great form of assistance in this process.

## How it works

Logged in users can personalize their account by choosing activities from our library and then matching them with a given mood. From there, the user is then able to swipe through personalized activities the next time that they use our application (we also have an unpersonalized experience for users without an account). Furthermore, once a user selects an activity we then render a map of all the local locations where they can pursue this activity. The user is then given two options. The first being the option to be redirected to an information page about the location. The second being the option for the user to get directions to the location. Lastly, users can also connect with users in their area if the user chooses so. This feature allows users to speak to someone if theyâ€™re in a really poor mood.
